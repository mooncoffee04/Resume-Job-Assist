Multimodal Clinical Insight Assistant (Neo4j + SeaweedFS Blob Storage deployed on Docker + Streamlit)
Built a fully working web app that allows doctor to login and access assigned patient cases. The doctor can retrieve medical records through
a simple text or voice command, supports all CRUD operations for lab reports, scan reports and generate a structure d SOAP note with the
help of a Gemini agent in the backend which is HIPAA and GDPR complaint. Efficiently store all records of the patient on Neo4 j Aura.
Breast Cancer Classification of DNA Sequences (Draft Paper Accepted)
Wrote a research paper and devised a classification model incorporating a combined Machine Learning and Deep Learning approac h to
classify forward and backward DNA sequences of cancerous and non -cancerous nature. This project proposes a non -invasive cancer
detection method.
Hospital Booking Management System (Django)
Developed a full -stack hospital appointment booking system using Django. Implemented secure user authentication and validation for
registration/login. Appointment slots are dynamically displayed based on doctor availability and updated in real -time post -booking. Ensured
smooth and intuitive scheduling flow for both patients and doctors.
Posture Check and Corrector (MediaPipe, SVM)
Built a desktop application using MediaPipe for real -time posture detection and correction. Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on
body landmarks to identify slouching behavior. Users receive instant alerts when improper posture is detected. The app was compiled into
a lightweight .exe for offline use.
MBTI Personality Predictor (Random Forest)
Developed an MBTI personality prediction model using a Random Forest classifier trained on labeled text data. Focused on inte rpretability
by extracting the top 25 most important linguistic features contributing to each personality type. Combined predictive modeling with
explainable AI to offer both classification and insightful personality analysis.
Effect of various factors on student’s examination grades
Project done using a survey conducted, and questions regarding their environment, study hours, health, motivation, location of study were
considered. ANOVA was conducted on these factors
